Abstract: Parking functions are a well-studied combinatorial object with numerous connections to other structures, like trees and posets.  They can also be seen in the maximal chains of the noncrossing partition lattice $NC_{n}$, an important partially ordered set (poset) that provides and ordering relation to all noncrossing set partitions on the integers 1 through $n$. Just as there are $(n+1)^{(n-1)}$ parking functions of length $n$, there are $(n+1)^{(n-1)}$ maximal chains in $NC_{n+1}$. Rota's 1964 work introduced a family of posets, called bond lattices, each of which are derived from a particular graph, creating a set of subposets of $NC_{n+1}$-- those derived from triangulation graphs-- each of which encodes a particular subset of the parking functions of length $n$. Our work builds on the work of a previous REU group, who found that the bond posets of certain triangulation graphs have the same number of maximal chains as there are ordered cycle decompositions on $n$ integers. Anders and Archer further showed that each ordered cycle decomposition corresponds to a rooted unimodal forest. Although there exist many bijections between parking functions and rooted forests, our work develops a recursive bijection between parking functions of a triangulation graph and unimodal unordered labelled rooted forests.
